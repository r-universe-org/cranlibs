  Return codes for command execution routines called from the command
  interpreter:

    cmdOK	execution of the command was adequately successful, further
		command interpretation should continue.
    cmdHALTNOERROR execution of the command was adequately successful, but break
		out of the command interpretation loop.
    cmdHALTERROR an error occurred during execution of the command, break
		out of the command interpretation loop.

  As return codes for process_cmds, the interpretation is slightly different:
    cmdOK	command interpretation was ended by an eof on the top level
		command channel (this is the normal case when command execution
		completes without error).
    cmdHALTNOERROR some command returned a cmdHALTNOERROR return code.
    cmdHALTERROR either a command returned a cmdHALTERROR return code, or a
		fatal error occurred in process_cmds.
